Goal
--------
An Etch-a-Sketch drawing pad where random colors will fill the 16x16 square grid with a progressive darkening effect. Users will be asked
a numberical value to decide the size of the grid but it shall not exceed 100. It will also includes a reset button and has a progressive darkening effect 
which ultimately end with a colored square.

Plan
---------
This project will have a minimal GUI an (n x n square grid, alert box and a button.)

1. As soon as the program loads alert box will prompt the user for an integer(n)<100 to create the grid

2. A square grid will be made of n size

3. A hover effect will be implemented every time a mouse pases with a random combination of RGB

4. Every time a mouses pases by a square grid each square will have a progressive darkening effect

5. Each square will get 10% darker and ultimately all the squares will be black

6. A reset button allow users to have a new grid.

Pseudocode(phase 1)
-------------
1. Create a container to hold the 16 x 16 squares using js 

2. Create the square divs(all 256) inside the big container

 - Make a single square container inside the bigger container

 - create the square div containers iteratively inside the bigger div containers

3. Applying a hover effect

 - How

 * Create a single div and change color when a mouse enter the div area. - DONE AND EFFECTIVE

4. Adding a button at the top of the grid and a prompt to ask the size of the grid to design - DONE AND EFFECTIVE

 - How
 * Make  aprompt to ask for the size of the grid
 
 * Create a button at the top of the button for triggering the alerting function and decide the size of the grid to be made

 * Apply random colorizing of the square every time a mosue hover over them

5. Applying a progressive darkening effect 
 - How
